<h3>Python</h3>
implant.py </br>
  The implant script in this repository functions as a comprehensive network, ip, and port scanner. It reads the interfaces that your machine can access and scans the interface for IPs, scans the IPs for ports, and scans the ports for open ports to be potentially exploited.
  
<h3>Metasploit (Ruby)</h3>
  The Metasploit folder contains 3 Ruby scripts I created for an offensive pen testing exploit. The target server these scripts are designed to run on is included in the folder as well as the assignment explanation in .pdf format.
  
<h3>PowerShell</h3>
  In the PowerShell folder there are two files, a PowerShell script (.ps1 file format) containing an offensive toolkit designed to locate a sensitive file, backdoor the target machine, and exfiltrate the file to a secure server. The .pdf file details the specifics for the assignment.
